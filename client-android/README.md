Android client.

this project is old and was last tested when the server was written in java, when the server was ported to C#,
the socket communication changed to XML. therefor it does not connect to server anymore.

it is much more limited compared to newer windows client. it is mainly here for reference and pieces parts.

updating the 2 send and recv socket classes should get it working. I may get around to doing this, or at least
you can use it as reference
